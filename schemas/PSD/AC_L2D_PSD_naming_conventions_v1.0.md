ArcticCerfi :: Live2D Layer Naming Conventions v1.0
====================================================
(Updated February 2025)

Here's a quick guide to my naming conventions in my VTuber model PSD files, so 
navigating them is easier. 

My Naming Conventions: 
- _L / _R = Left / Right (e.g., "Eye_L" for the left eye) 
- _F / _B = Front / Back (e.g., "Choker_F" & "Choker_B" are front and back layers for the same object) 
- _PREVIEW = Layers just for looks in an art program outside of Live2D --these arenâ€™t needed for Live2D and should be deleted or hidden. 
- _DUP = Layers that will be duplicated in Live2D (e.g., spikes, shine effects). 
- _Mask = Layers meant to be used as a clipping mask/invert mask in Live2D. 

Other things of note: 

Mouths are drawn as a neutral straight line to minimize artifacting. The actual mouth layers are hidden by default, with a visible Dummy_Mouth layer that should be deleted or hidden before rigging.
